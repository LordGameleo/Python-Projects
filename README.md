# Python-Projects
This repository contains my python projects which I am using as stepping stones to explore this field.

Projects: 

**youtube.py**:
  - In this project I have used "requests" library of python to get response from Google API to get the top most search         result from youtube.
  - To set this script on your own system you have to create API credentials from Google Developers API Console. Replace the Key at {YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY}
