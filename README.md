# Python-Projects
This repository contains my python projects which I am using as stepping stones to explore this field.

Projects: 

**Youtube.py**:
  - In this project I used:
    >Requests
    >BeautifulSoup
    >Google API - Youtube Data
    
  - To set this script on your own system you have to create API credentials from Google Developers API Console. Replace the Key at {YOUR_YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY}
  
**Cricket.py**:
  - In this project I used:
    >Requests
    >BeautifulSoup
    >Notify2
    >Win10toast
